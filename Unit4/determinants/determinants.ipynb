    "## Determinants using SVD\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the singular value decomposition (check the SVD notebook in the unit 3 dir if you need a refresher).\n",
    "\n",
    "$A_{m \\times n} = U \\Sigma V^T$\n",
    "\n",
    "Every matrix can be decomposed with the SVD, and the properties of $U$, $\\Sigma$, and $V^T$ are often exploited to accomplish other operations or tasks. Despite the fact that a SVD can be computed for any $A_{m \\times n}$ we only really compute determinants for square matrices. For non-square matrices determinant computations may work, but for the sake of remaining focused on the numerical methods, is regarded as more of a not particularly useful pseudo-determinant without it being the actual pseudo-determinant (WARNING: this is a deep rabbit hole to go down). Because of this, we'll only consider computong determinants for square matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the determinant we can see the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\det{(A)} = \\det{(U \\Sigma V^T)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\det{(A)} = \\det{(U)} \\det{(\\Sigma)} \\det{(V^T)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$U$ and $V$ are orthogonal so their determinants will be $\\pm 1$. Knowing if the determinant is positive or negative is not always important so we can just simplify using the absolute value.\n",
    "\n",
    "$|\\det{(A)}| = \\det{(\\Sigma)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $\\Sigma$ is a square, diagonal matrix with the singular values running down the diagonal in decending order, computing $\\det{(\\Sigma)}$ just becomes the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$|\\det{(A)}| = \\displaystyle \\prod_i{diag(\\Sigma)_i} = \\displaystyle \\prod_{i=1}^n \\sigma_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $n$ is the total number of singular values.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this won't quite give us the actual determinant, but will give us the absolute value of the determinant, which in many cases will be useful enough in of itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following code will test this method against `np.linalg.det()` which uses a different backend method for computing the determinant."

    "So the above result agrees very well with the previous $\\det(A)$ value obtained with `np.linalg.det()`. Plus the $LU$ decomposition has $O(n^3)$ time complexity, so while it isn't the fastest method, it still just relies on matrix multiplication and is relatively respectable. Matrix multiplication can be spead up with the *Strassen Algorithm* which efectively follows the same process we took here, however has closer to $O(n^{2.5})$ time complexity (THIS IS NOT EXACT, DON\"T QUOTE ME ON IT, the point is to say Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication is faster). I don't have any notes on the *Strassen Algorithm* yet, so I may need to create those in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also do note `scipy.linalg.lu()` uses a permutation matrix, hence `p, L, U = scipy.linalg.lu(A.copy())` which is another way of doing a $LU$ decomposition that differs slightly from my notes on the $LU$ decomposition, however the same idea will apply to both cases. When using a permutation matrix, like in this case with the scipy function, we get the $\\pm 1$ from the determinant of the permutation matrix. So in the above code we are only guaranteed $|\\det (A)|$ like in the case of using SVD.\n",

What's meant by the term \"integer determinants\" is that no floats will be used, and only mathematics operations will be conducted with integer values. Its named after Erwin Bareiss who formally proposed the algorithm in 1968 in a paper called *Sylvester’s identity and multistep integer-preserving Gaussian elimination*. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a bit of a weird and special case, but a cool algorithm that I thought would be interesting to explore with the topic of numerical methods for computing determinants. \n",
    "\n",
    "Practically speaking, the Bareiss Algorithm appears to be to be marginally better (from the sources I've read through) compared to using $LU$ with Gaussian elimination since Gaussian Elimination introduces division, which, therefore requires the use of floating point values. Keeping a consistent integer data type and allowing for arithmetic operations to be done strictly using integers, clearly, in theory, allows the Bareiss Algorithm to be more performant than $LU$ with Gaussian Elimination because of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps for performing the Bareiss Algorithm are not super straight forward, but the following is my best description of the steps to perform the Bareiss Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a sign factor $=1$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Iterate through columns: For each column index $k = 0, 1, ..., n-2$ and search for a zero on the diagonal. If $A[k][k] = 0$, then search for a non-zero element in the same column below the current row. Perform a row swap to eliminate the zero, i.e., interchange rows $k$ and $l$, and multiply the sign factor every time we swap rows by $-1$.\n",
    "$$\\begin{pmatrix} A[k] \\\\ A[l] \\end{pmatrix} \\mapsto \\begin{pmatrix} A[l] \\\\ A[k] \\end{pmatrix}.$$\n",

    "3. Eliminate columns below the diagonal: For each column index $i > k$ and each column index $j \\geq k+1$, compute:\n",
    "$$a_{ij} = a_{kk} \\cdot a_{ij} - a_{ik} \\cdot a_{kj}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Divide rows below by the pivot element. If $k > 0$, then for each row index $i > k$, divide all elements in that row by the pivot element.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the top-right corner is reached\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Multiply the sign factor and last diagonal element\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't take this decription as 100% accurate. Again, this process is still not entirely clear to me, but I wanted to provide a description to be best of my current understanding as of writing."
